This project involves a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using MicrosoftSQL for data manipulation and Tableau for data visualization.

The dataset, "Pizza_Sales.csv," contains information about pizzas, orders, and sales.

The analysis covers various aspects, including identifying the best and worst selling pizzas, determining total revenue generated, calculating average revenue, and examining Revenue trends over time scales.

# The dataset includes the following columns:

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `order_id: Unique identifier for each order placed by a table
● order_details_id: Unique identifier for each pizza placed within each order (pizzas of the

● pizza_id: Unique key identifier that ties the pizza ordered to its details, like size and price
● quantity: Quantity ordered for each pizza of the same type and size
● order_date: Date the order was placed (entered into the system prior to cooking & serving)
● order_time: Time the order was placed (entered into the system prior to cooking & serving)
● unit_price: Price of the pizza in USD
● total_price: unit_price * quantity
● pizza_size: Size of the pizza (Small, Medium, Large, X Large, or XX Large)

Mozzarella Cheese, even if not specified; and they all include Tomato Sauce, unless another sauce

● pizza_name: Name of the pizza as shown in the menu

## SQL Queries Used

The following SQL queries were used to obtain insights from the dataset:

1. **Best and Worst Selling Pizzas:** SQL queries were used to identify the best and worst selling pizzas based on total quantity sold.

2. **Total Revenue Generated:** SQL query calculated the total revenue generated by summing the `Total_unit_sold` for all pizzas.

3. **Average Revenue Generated:** SQL query calculated the average revenue generated per pizza.

4. **Total Number of Pizzas Sold:** SQL query calculated the Total Number of Pizzas Sold.

5. **Average Pizzas per order:** SQL query calculated the Average Pizzas per order.


## Tableau Visualization

Tableau was used to create various visualizations to explore and validate the analysis results:

- **Total Revenue Over Time (Line Chart):** Shows the total revenue over time.

- **Revenue by Item (Bar Chart):** Provides a Revenue by time of different pizza items.

- **Weekly Sales Overview (Area Chart):** Displays weekly sales fluctuations within a month.

- **Pizza Performance Dashboard (Interactive Doughnut Chart):** Presents the percentage breakdown of pizza sales and individual pizza performance.

- **All-Time High and Low Sales (Gantt Chart):** Identifies historical sales peaks and lows.
